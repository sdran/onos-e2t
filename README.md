Welcome to the open source release version 1.1.1 of ONF's SD-RAN project. Please note that this is a read only release of the source code. We will not be accepting pull requests in these repos, and the source code that is contained here cannot be used to build functional binaries because it refers back to a number of private repositories. But executables - docker containers referencing the released code - are available on Docker Hub and referenced [here](https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/SD-RAN+1.1+Release).  SD-RAN is currently a member-only project, and ONF membership is required to access the most current release, the master branch, and to do development with SD-RAN.

# onos-e2t
E2 AP Termination module for ONOS SD-RAN (ÂµONOS Architecture)

## Overview

The E2 Termination (E2T) acts as an intelligent proxy and adapter for managing the interactions betwen SD-RAN components and E2 nodes. The southbound of E2T implements the E2AP specification (ASN.1 over SCTP), and the northbound implements the onos-e2t API as specified within the [onos-api]. Messages traveling southbound through E2T nodes are converted from Protobuf to ASN.1, and those received from the environment are converted from ASN.1 to Protobuf before they're propagated up through the northbound API. This process can be extended for service models with plugins.

The E2 Termination service relies heavily on [onos-e2sub] to manage subscriptions. E2T nodes listen for change to subscriptions within the subscription service. When a subscription is assigned to an E2T node, E2T creates the subscription on the appropriate E2 node and begins propagating indications through its northbound API.

The E2 termination is shipped as a [Docker] image and deployed with [Helm]. To build the Docker image, run `make images`.
